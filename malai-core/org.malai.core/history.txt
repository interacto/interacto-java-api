Version 2.0
- change: Instruments that use Swing widgets should inherits of the class SwingInstrument
- change: Should use the interfaces Instrument, Interactor, and Interaction instead of their implementation class when possible.
  So, the classes Instrument, Interactor, and Interaction have been renamed as InstrumentImpl, InteractorImpl, and InteractionImpl.
- change: API renaming: State, Transition -> StateImpl, TransitionImpl; IState, ITransition, IStateMachine -> State, Transition, StateMachine.
- change: AbortableDnD and the transition EscapeKeyPressureTransition are now part of org.malai.core

*******************************************************************
Version 1.3 -- 2014-09-14

- fixed: some transitions of key-based interactions were always triggered
- fixed: infinite loop when continuously pressing a key.
- change: Link renamed as Interactor

*******************************************************************
Version 1.2

- The executing of an action may provoke the execution of other actions. 
For instance with a drawing editor, one may want that after having pasting shapes, the new shapes must be selected.
Thus, the action PasteShapes will be followed by an action SelectShapes.
This is the goal of this feature.

*******************************************************************
Version 1.1 - November 4th 2012

- Malai is now separated in several components (core, Swing, android, etc.)
- Two interactions added to the library
- Fixed: action not created when the last event of the interaction permits its creation.
